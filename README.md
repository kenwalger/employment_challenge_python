####More About Us

Our developers and designers run the show with management existing only to 
support, not dictate. We hire creative people and give them the autonomy to do 
great work. We're strongly against artificial separations of responsibility and 
throwing work "over the wall." 

Our office is in New York City (but you don't have to be).

We built XXXXX to be an insanely great place to work. All jobs include the 
incredible benefits listed on our jobs page.

We welcome all applicants regardless of race, color, ethnicity, actual or 
perceived sexual identity, gender identity, gender expression, economic status, 
ability, disability, religious beliefs or disbeliefs, national origin, age, 
military service eligibility, veteran status, marital status, parental status, 
or caregiver status.

####How to apply…

Write code (in the text box provided below) to find a 9 letter string of 
characters that contains only letters from

```
acdegilmnoprstuw
```

such that the hash(the_string) is

```
930846109532517
```

if hash is defined by the following pseudo-code:

```
Int64 hash (String s) {
   Int64 h = 7
   String letters = "acdegilmnoprstuw"
   for(Int32 i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
       h = (h * 37 + letters.indexOf(s[i]))
   }
   return h
}
```

For example, if we were trying to find the 7 letter string where 
`hash(the_string)` was `680131659347`, the answer would be "leepadg".
